# Tic-Tac-Toe

- To create a tic tac toe using java , you should create a class where we will create the main method and then we should extend it to another class.
- Then we should create the other class to write the actual code and the rest of things.
- After that to run our program we should come to our main class and then just run it.
- You will get a output of a purely working virtual calculator. 
- This is how it looks like - 👇🏻👇🏻
